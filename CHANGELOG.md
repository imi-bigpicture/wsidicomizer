- Correct `LossyImageCompressionRatio` for `OpenTileImageData`.

## [0.16.0] - 2025-01-29

### Added

- Support for reading isyntax files using pyisyntax.

### Fixed

- Reading correct image size in pyramid series in Bioformats reader.
- Skip non-dyadic pyramid series in Bioformats reader.
- Missing values in `LossyImageCompressionRatio` and `LossyImageCompressionMethod` when converting without re-encoding.
- Pin zarr to <3.0 to fix import exception.

## [0.15.1] - 2025-01-07

### Fixed

- Update of wsidicom dependency to 0.22.0 to fix openslide compatibility.
- Parsing of acquisition datetime for czi-files with zone designation with Python <3.11.

## [0.15.0] - 2024-10-21

### Added

- Support for pydicom 3.0. This requires Pyhton >3.10.

### Removed

- Support for Python 3.9.
- Support for pydicom <3.

### Changed

- Unpinned requirement for numpy to support numpy 2.

## [0.14.2] - 2024-07-01

### Fixed

- Update opentile version to fix missing file handle closing.

## [0.14.1] - 2024-05-07

### Fixed

- Fix stripes with missing image data for czi source.
- Fix possible cache deadlock for czi source.

## [0.14.0] - 2024-04-15

### Added

- Added `add_missing_levels` parameter to cli.

## [0.13.0] - 2024-02-15

### Added

- Support for incorporating ICC profiles from source image if available. This is currently limited to images read by the `OpenTile` and `OpenSlide` source, and only for supported formats (primarily `Aperio svs`).

- If no ICC profile is present in the source file or the provided metadata, an empty profile will be used if the photometric interpretation requires it for DICOM compatibility. This behavior can be disabled with `settings.insert_icc_profile_if_missing = False`

## [0.12.1] - 2024-01-12

### Fixed

- Fixed missing support for Python 3.12.

## [0.12.0] - 2024-01-12

### Changed

- Replaced `Dataset` based metadata by `modules`-parameter to `open()` and `convert()` with metadata models from `WsiDicom`. Use the `metadata`-parameter to define metadata that should override any metadata found in the source file, and the`default_metadata`-parameter to define metadata that should be used if no other metadata is defiend.

### Fixed

- Fixed fetching empty tile regions with tiffslide and openslide.

## [0.11.0] - 2023-12-10
